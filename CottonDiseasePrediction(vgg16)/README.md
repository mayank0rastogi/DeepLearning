## The purpose of this notebook is to predict wheather the image belongs to diseased class or not. In this dataset we have 4 classes diseased leaf , diseased plant , freash leaf and freash plant.I will use  Vgg16 model from keras to train the model by taking the imagenet weight  and will check that testing image is belongs to which class.

Building the Advanced CNN model by taking the vgg16 pretrained model and weight in this i have taken is imagenet
and Predicting for 4 classes that is we customize the last layer of vgg16 model
